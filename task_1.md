# Task 1 - Research & Analysis

To identify best practices and user pain points:

## Best Practices:

- **Minimal Required Fields**: Ask only for necessary information to avoid overwhelming users.
- **Logical Grouping**: Group related information together for clarity.
- **Clear Labels & Tooltips**: Ensure labels are clear, with optional tooltips for guidance.
- **Error Feedback**: Give immediate feedback for errors.

## User Pain Points:

- **Overly Long Forms**: Users don't like forms that feel tedious or repetitive.
- **Unclear Error Messages**: Confusing errors frustrate users and can cause them to abandon the form.
- **Poor Mobile Experience**: Forms that aren't optimized for mobile screens are challenging to navigate on smaller screens.
- **Lack of Visual Guidance**: Without clear labels, users can feel unsure of whatâ€™s required.
